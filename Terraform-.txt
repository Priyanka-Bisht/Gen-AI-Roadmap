When we run terraform init, plugins required for the provider are automatically downloaded and saved locally to a .terraform directory.

	[ResourceType]  [LocalName]
resource "aws_instance" "first_ec2"{
	ami = "..."
	instance_type = "..."
}

To destroy a specific resource:
terraform destroy -target aws_instance.myec2

For referencing attributes:
Let's assume Public_ip with cidr block - ${aws_eip.publicip.public_ip}/32


Change in terraform taint command after v0.15.2 version
Terraform Taint - terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.myec2"

spalt expression -
[*] - Gives list of resources.

Zipmap = maps keys and values from list.

Provisioners - used to execute scripts on local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction.

terraform import new functionality available from version 1.5 onwards.

Sentinal - Policy-as-code framework integrated with the hashicorp enterprise products.

Note: if you are getting an error even your code is correct check that which provider version and terraform version you are using.
	terraform init -upgrate
